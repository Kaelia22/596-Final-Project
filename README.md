Our project aims to utilize VMD to visualize thermal equilibrium in molecular dynamics simulations by color-coding atoms based on their kinetic energy. The system provides a dynamic enviornment to observe the process of temperature equilibration after initially assigning distinct high temperatures to one side of a MD simulation box and low temperatures to the other side. The color-coded represenation allows users to intuitively track the distrubution and flow of energy across the system over time. Our approach facilitates a deeper understanding of thermal equilibrium while simultaneously providing a visually engaging method for analyzing energy exchanges in MD simulations.

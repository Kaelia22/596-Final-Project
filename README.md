# CSCI Final Project: Visualizing Thermal Equilibrium

### Problem Description

### Project Objectives
The goal of our project is to color-code atoms with their kinetic-energy values to help visualize thermal equilibrium. We attempt to initialize half the MD box at a high temperature and the other half at a low temperature to try and observe how these temperatures will equilibrate.
